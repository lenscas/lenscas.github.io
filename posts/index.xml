It is a GREAT hack that the guys over at utteranc made, and I love it.
Anyway, that is all have a great day :)</description></item><item><title>F# and Godot part 1</title><link>http://example.org/posts/fsharp_godot_part1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 01:23:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/fsharp_godot_part1/</guid><description>In this part I will touch on why I chose F# instead of the many other languages that I know and could&amp;rsquo;ve used with godot. In addition it also goes over on how to set it up.
Part 2 will go over how to do some basic things in Godot with F#, like how to emit signals.
In part 3 we take a bit deeper dive into F# and use some of its features to extend one of Godot&amp;rsquo;s libraries so it becomes easier to use.</description></item><item><title>Hello_World!</title><link>http://example.org/posts/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:10:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/hello_world/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Lenscas, just a random developer wanting to have a place to put his thoughts on. As well as put updates for projects and maybe some other stuff.
We will see :)
Expect to see content about my (still heavily in development) card game and other stuff I end up working on.
Currently planned (not in this order) :
my thoughts on Quicksilver, the libraries I made for it and its sad demise a dive into using F# with Godot.</description></item></channel></rss>
