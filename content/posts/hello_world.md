I'm Lenscas, just a random developer wanting to have a place to put his thoughts on. As well as put updates for projects and maybe some other stuff.  
We will see :)

Expect to see content about my (still heavily in development) card game and other stuff I end up working on.  
Currently planned (not in this order) : 
* my thoughts on Quicksilver, the libraries I made for it and its sad demise 
* a dive into using F# with Godot.
* Maybe a progress update on Card game if that suddenly goes faster.
