As well as put updates for projects and maybe some other stuff.
We will see :)
Expect to see content about my (still heavily in development) card game and other stuff I end up working on.
Currently planned (not in this order) :
my thoughts on Quicksilver, the libraries I made for it and its sad demise a dive into using F# with Godot.</description></item></channel></rss>
